## Hi there! 
I’m Daria Ternovskaya – a graduate of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU) and Pythonnista 🐍.

👀 I love coding, analytics, yoga, foreign languages and ... life!

👩🏻‍💻 Currently I learn software testing and work on my own project – a web-application that leverages Spotify and Youtube APIs to deliver music lovers the benefits of integrating these two awesome apps.
