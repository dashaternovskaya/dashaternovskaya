## Hi there 👩🏻‍💻
I’m Daria Ternovskaya – a graduate of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU) and Pythonnista.

👀 I’m interested in coding, analytics, yoga, foreign languages and ... life!

🌱 Currently I'm learning the theory of software testing and working on my own project – a web-application that leverages Spotify and Youtube APIs to deliver the benefits of integration these two apps for melomans.
